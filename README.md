# CS404-RSS-Aggregator
My Final Project for CS-404 Adv. Web &amp; Internet Programming is a React+MUI+Electron RSS Aggregator


## Get Started
1. Ensure you have node installed (tested with v18.8.0)
2. Download/Clone the repo and navigate to the root folder in a terminal
3. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies
4. There are a few options to get the program running:
    1. `npm start` builds the react application using esbuild and launches it in electron
    2. `npm run client` uses esbuild to create a production, minified, build
    3. `npm run client:dev` uses esbuild to create a development build (and rebuild on any changes)
    4. `npm run electron` will launch the electron app using the most recent build
    5. `npm run electron:stay` is useful in development as it relaunches the program if accidentally closed
